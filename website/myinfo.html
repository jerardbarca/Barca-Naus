	<p> My name Jerard Ray G. Barca , Son of Mrs. Ruth And Mr. Alfonso Barca, as a firt-born son , 
	I was a responsible for my family sake and being a  imitate for my youngiest siblings.
	I was trained and have skill in combat by tought of my Dad either dicipline tought me properly. 
	Sunddely in my life my Father left us and make a decision that I dont like. As a First-born son 	
	I will make sure that my desicion is for the rest not for me , so I decided that my father have to leave instead of my Mom.
	Deep inside I want to my Father to stay and give the second chance but my priority is the good of the rest,
	I Love My MOM and Im glad to see her smile. However when my MOM is happy because the great things happen, 
	Mylife is now in danger because Im now suffering in mental disease that called "DEPRESSION". Many of us know the disease 
	but they never know what is feel. Well depression is not easy to fight against because you cannot control
	this is the feel like you watching your dreams and reality fight. Its hard to get up because the some people who 
	discriminate us and make ourself more harder to get over. Now Im fine ,finded a true friends and help me to get up. 
	In my HighSchool life , I was a student who doing a bad things like a cutting classes.
	But now I`am gonna change my life by doing the thing that I should do before.</p>
